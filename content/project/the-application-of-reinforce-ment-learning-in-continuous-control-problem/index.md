We apply a reinforcement learning algorithm as an intelligent decision algorithm to realize the manipulator's smart grasping process. Cartesian coordinate variables output is generated by RGB image information and controls the action of the manipulator in continuous space Finally, we achieve autonomous grasping of workpieces having various shapes without manually altering the control algorithm.
