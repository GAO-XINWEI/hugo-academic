## Abstract

We propose an Individual Voting mechanism to optimize the algorithm's performance in
dead/livelock situations by learning to combine a decentralized RL algorithm and a centralized search-based algorithm. Our method significantly improves the large scale Multi-agent Path finding problem's success rate and has a shorter path length in terms of the efficiency of path planning.
